# Sentiment-analysis

This project was basically to check whether the release of the new phone ROG ASUS was a success or not.
The dataset which I used were basically comments people gave on different shopping sites like amazon, flipkart, etc.
I simply made a text file out of those comments and applied sentiment analysis on it.
Using sentiment analysis I was able check how many comments were in the favor of this phone and how many were negative comments.
This project also has data visualizations of all my analysis.
This project also gives a sentiment score at the end. That is positive comments minus negative comments.
This technique is usefull in business point of view.
We can see what are the current trends going on.
What all featutres does the present generation demands from their smartphones.
